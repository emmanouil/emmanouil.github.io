title: The gist of the forthcoming MPEG video codecs
---

The Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) is on the final stretch to release three video codecs as ISO standards. For those that do not want to bother with the details, but instead looking to get a very broad idea, you can find bellow one sentence for each codec summing up its key point.   

Versatile Video Coding (VVC), MPEG-I Part 3:   
_Successor to HEVC/H.265, with improved quality (and increased complexity)_.   

Essential Video Coding (EVC), MPEG-5 Part 1:   
_Royalty-free Baseline profile, outperforming AVC/H.264 and royalty-bearing "configurable" Main profile, outperforming HEVC/H.265_.   

Low-complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC), MPEG-5 Part 2:   
_Backwards-compatible hardware-supported base layer stream (e.g. AVC), and a software enhancement layer, with quality and complexity gains (comparing to the base layer's next generation codec)_.   

If you would like more details, you can either dive in the [MPEG public website](https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/), or check [this article](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/Inside-MPEGs-Ambitious-Plan-to-Launch-3-Video-Codecs-in-2020-134694.aspx) by Streaming Media, that also mentions the motivation behind each codec.
