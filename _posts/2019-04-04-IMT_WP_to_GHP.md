title: Migrating from IMT Wordpress to Github Pages
---

I am currently migrating the content from my former webspace to GitHub pages. 
So, for the foreseeable future this whole internet presence will be under construction.

In the meantime, you can contact me at pοtetsiαnakίs [at] outlook [dot] com (hint: copy-paste will not work)

As you might observed, this is built using [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) as a starting point.
