This is yet-another vanity page; this time for (and by) Emmanouil Potetsianakis.

---

My current research areas of interest are: Multimedia (Systems and Applications), User Experience, Web Technologies

From 2013 to 2019, I was an R&D Engineer at the Multimedia Group of Telecom ParisTech graduate engineering school.

My work was focused on multimedia systems for recording/streaming/consuming interactive content. Open-source projects I contributed to include [GPAC](gpac.io) and [SWAPUGC](https://acmmmsys.github.io/2018-SWAPUGC/) (amond others).

I have also previously worked on projects focused on: Distributed Systems, Brain-Computer Interfaces, Sensor Networks.

For a more “formal” insight to my work, you can find a somewhat complete list of my publications here, at [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emmanouil_Potetsianakis/publications), or at [google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=MfmqI4EAAAAJ).
