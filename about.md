I am a Researcher at [Xiaomi](xiaomi.com) at the Industry Standards Research Department. My current research areas of interest are: Multimedia (Systems and Applications), Streaming Technologies, Immersive Media Formats, and Web Technologies.

Previously (2019-2022), I was a Researcher at [MediaLab](https://tnomedialab.github.io/) of the Networks Unit of [TNO](https://tno.nl/en) (the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research). My research areas of interest were: Multimedia (Systems and Applications), Immersive Media, User Experience and Web Technologies. Before that (2013-2019), I was an R&D Engineer at the Multimedia Team of [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) graduate engineering school of [Paris Polytechnic Institute](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en/). My work was focused on multimedia systems for recording/streaming/consuming interactive content. Open-source projects I contributed to include [GPAC](http://www.gpac.io) and [SWAPUGC](https://acmmmsys.github.io/2018-SWAPUGC/) (among others).

I have also previously worked on projects focused on: Distributed Systems, Brain-Computer Interfaces, Sensor Networks.

For a more “formal” insight to my work, you can find a somewhat complete list of my publications [here](https://emmanouil.github.io/publications), at [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emmanouil_Potetsianakis/publications), or at [google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=MfmqI4EAAAAJ).
