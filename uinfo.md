My _Erdös number_ is at most **_4_** (_Paul Erdős — Peter Winkler — Kin K. Leung — Andrzej Duda — Emmanouil Potetsianakis_).   
    
I used to have a [tumblr account](http://le-cloporte.tumblr.com/) (containing mixtapes).    
Also, some time ago, with a couple of friends, we released an album (probably still available in [apple music](https://music.apple.com/ua/album/impulse/1752273013), [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/a-brief-moment), [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5I0NPVIRuVcJq4KEq8CSiK), or [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUkX6DmhvBv4JN9CzfxXHxQ)).          
And even a longer timer ago, I used to occasionally DJ with my [Tsarouchi Soundsystem](https://www.mixcloud.com/tsarouxi/) mates.

   
I believe that research should be accessible to everyone – regardless of status / affiliation / location; thus, even though I do not use them, I like the idea of projects like sci-hub and booksc.
